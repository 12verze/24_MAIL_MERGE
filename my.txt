Hello my name is Vishu

with open("file") as file:
no need to close it after open
open("file", nmode = "r")
r = read, a = append , = w = write
write creates from scratch and rewrite also
a appends
file.write("content")

root of all files = /
/work/project/text.txt
directing towards to the path of the file of interest, this is absolute file path

if we want path relaive from some folder we are in
./report/text.txt

 . = forward
 .. = backward or up

 ../report.doc
 getting hold of file up in the hierarchy

 we can simply open the file if it is in same level or folder
 ./report.doc
 or u can skip the formality of ./ also if it is in same folder

 but if it is different folder have to follow the convection
 basically if we  are changing the directory of the file we have to find the path of the file to get the file we want to work with.

 ex = \Users\vishu\PycharmProjects\day 20\day24
 in windows we represent using backward slash but in python it deosn't care much.

 ../../desktop/myfile.text
 here i went two folders up anf found the file it.
